- Central Processing Unit: Runs the Program - The CPU is always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but very very fast
- Input devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Touch Screen
- Output devices: Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner
- Main Memory: Fast small temporary storage - lost on reboot - aka RAM
- Secondary Memory: Slower large permanent storage - lasts until deleted - disk drive / memory stick
